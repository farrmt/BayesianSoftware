# Introduction to Bayesian software in R

Prior to the workshop please make sure you have a working and recent version of [R](https://repo.miserver.it.umich.edu/cran/) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). You will also need to download [JAGS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/). Please install the `tidyverse`, `rmarkdown`, and `jagsUI` packages for day 1. Please install the `rstan`, `rstanarm`, `brms`, and `nimble` packages for day 2. If R ask for dependencies, please accept.
